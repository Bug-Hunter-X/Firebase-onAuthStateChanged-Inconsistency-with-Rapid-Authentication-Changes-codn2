# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where rapid authentication state changes can lead to inconsistent updates.  The provided code examples illustrate the problem and a possible solution using debouncing to mitigate the issue.

## Problem:
Rapid authentication state changes (e.g., frequent sign-in/sign-out) might cause the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to miss certain state transitions. This can result in unexpected behavior in your application.

## Solution:
The solution employs a debouncing technique to limit the rate at which the listener processes state changes. This approach prevents the listener from being overwhelmed by rapid changes, ensuring it only processes updates at a reasonable interval.
